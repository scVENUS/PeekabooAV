## Getting Started ##

### Prerequisites ####

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.6+ required)
* [Cuckoo 2.0](https://github.com/cuckoosandbox/cuckoo)
* [AMaViSd 2.11.0](https://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/)
* Installer is available: [PeekabooAV-Installer](https://github.com/scVENUS/PeekabooAV-Installer)


### Installation ###

Install from PyPI into a new virtual environment:
```shell
virtualenv --python=python3 /path/to/venv
/path/to/venv/bin/pip install peekabooav
```

Or use this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/scVENUS/PeekabooAV.git
virtualenv --python=python3 /path/to/venv
/path/to/venv/bin/pip install .
```

This will pull in all required packages and install them into the virtualenv.

### Configuration ###
Take a look at ``peekaboo.conf.sample`` and ``ruleset.conf.sample``.


## Running the tests ##

Runs the unit tests
```shell
/path/to/venv/bin/python tests/test.py
```


## Usage ##

Now, you can run PeekabooAV with
```shell
/path/to/venv/bin/peekaboo -c /path/to/your/peekaboo.conf
```

**Note:** If you put your PeekabooAV configuration file at
``/opt/peekaboo/etc/peekaboo.conf`` you can omit the ``-c`` option.
Also, for detailed command line options run
```shell
peekaboo --help
```

### Development Quickstart ###

Just install Peekaboo using pip like above but in editable/development mode:

```shell
/path/to/venv/bin/pip install -e .
```

Now you can run it as before but changes to the source code will take effect
without reinstallation.
See the [development documentation](docs/source/development.rst) for details.
