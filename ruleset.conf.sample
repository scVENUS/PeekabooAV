#[cuckoo_analysis_failed]
# This rule checks whether analysis by Cuckoo failed. If so, it reports a
# result of "failed" for this sample and aborts rule processing. In case of
# success, result "unknown" is returned (because successful analysis in itself
# provides no indication about the sample) and rule processing is continued.
#
# The following strings are matched in the order listed against the
# debug/cuckoo log of the report, i.e. the server's messages about the
# analysis. Order of evaluation is failure -> success -> fallback: failure,
# which means:
#
# - if any failure string is contained in any log entry, the analysis is
#   considered failed and evaluation is aborted
# - if any success string is contained in any log entry, the analysis is
#   considered successfully finished and evaluation is aborted
# - if no string matches, the analysis is considered failed
#
# Failure strings are optional but there has to be at least one success string
# to prevent the rule from always reporting failure. If the rule is supposed to do
# nothing, it should be disabled instead of providing no or very permissive
# match strings.

# default:
#success.1: analysis completed successfully
# no failure

# possible more specific config: 'end of analysis reached!' shows that the
# analysis ran beyond the analysis timeout and into the critical timeout which
# is a clear indicator that it did not succeed (for whatever reason)
#failure.1: end of analysis reached!

# rules without configuration options:
# - known
# - contains_peekabooyar
# - office_macro
# - final_rule
