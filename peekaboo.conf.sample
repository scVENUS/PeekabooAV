# - config_path: full path of the main configuration file
# - config_file: basename of the main configuration file
# - config_dir: directory containing the main configuration file
#drop_dir_template: {config_path}.d

# drop files are sorted lexicographically before being read. Therefore, a
# leading (constant length!) numbering or ordering scheme allows to govern read
# order. Making it part of the globbing pattern is not required and only
# provides some more robustness regarding stray files and typos.

[cluster]
# if multiple instances are to run in parallel and avoid concurrent analysis of
# the same sample, set instance_id to a nonzero positive unique integer value
# on each instance and use the same networked DBMS instance (MySQL or
# PostgreSQL) for all them. (SQLite is not a good choice for this.) Also, do
# make really, really sure to provide unique IDs. Two instances using the same
# ID will corrupt each others' records and there is no mechanism to detect this.
