[cluster]
# if multiple instances are to run in parallel and avoid concurrent analysis of
# the same sample, set instance_id to a nonzero positive unique integer value
# on each instance and use the same networked DBMS instance (MySQL or
# PostgreSQL) for all them. (SQLite is not a good choice for this.) Also, do
# make really, really sure to provide unique IDs. Two instances using the same
# ID will corrupt each others' records and there is no mechanism to detect this.
instance_id: 0

# number of seconds after which in-flight markers of samples are to be
# removed/ignored, assuming that the instance processing them has crashed or
# been shut down.

# Interval in which to check if other instances of a Peekaboo cluster have
# finished processing samples we have held.
